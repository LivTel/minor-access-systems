Timing: Must contain a <timing> section.

Constraints:

Must contain a <constraints> section. Any constraints supplied are added, no others are inferred. May be no constraints in section.

airmass 
 max: 
	1.0 <= max <= 5.0

seeing 
 class: 
	GOOD
	AVERAGE

hour-angle
 min: 
	-180.0 < min <= 180.0
 max:
	-180.0 < max <= 180.0


Sequence:

Must contain a sequence section. The order of components IS important. Currently this is not checked other than for existance of targets and configs. For FRODO there is a specific setup required in order to acquire correctly. 
	   

Units for angles:

      as, asec, asecs, arcsec, arcsecs,
      d, deg, degs,
      r, rad, rads,
      h, hour, hours

Units for time periods:
      
      ms, milli, millis, msec, msecs, millisec, millisecs,
      s, sec, secs,
      m, min, mins,
      h, hour, hours,
      d, day, days
      
Units for distance: (defocus)

      mm, mu, micron, microns

Valid instrument names (note: case sensitive):

      RATCam 
      RISE
      IO:O
      RINGO2
      FRODO       (used as acquisition target instrument in preference to red or blue arm)
      FRODO_RED   (when configuring red arm)
      FRODO_BLUE  (when configuring blue arm)
      IO:THOR (TBC)

Valid lamp names: (note: case sensitive):
